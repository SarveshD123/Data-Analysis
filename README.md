# Anime Data Analysis
# Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis of a top anime dataset. The dataset includes information such as:

UID: Unique identifier for each anime
Title: Anime title
Rank: Ranking of the anime
Streamtype: Type of streaming (e.g., TV, Movie)
Episodes: Number of episodes
Start Date: Start date of the anime
End Date: End date of the anime
Members: Number of members in the anime's community
Score: Average user rating
Episodes-binned: Binned number of episodes
Streamtype_Movie: Binary indicator for movie type
Streamtype_TV: Binary indicator for TV type
# Data Analysis Goals
The primary goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the anime industry. Specific objectives include:

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Understand the distribution of key variables, identify outliers, and uncover relationships between variables.
Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical tests to determine the significance of differences between groups and correlations between variables.
Data Visualization: Create informative visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
Predictive Modeling: Develop models to predict anime popularity or other relevant factors.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Before conducting the analysis, the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure data quality:
Handling Missing Values: Missing values were handled appropriately, either by imputation or removal.
Outlier Detection and Treatment: Outliers were identified and addressed using appropriate techniques.
Feature Engineering: New features were created to enhance the analysis, such as duration, release year, and seasonality.

# Data Analysis Techniques
The following techniques were employed to analyze the dataset:
Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) were calculated for numerical variables.
Data Visualization: Histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and other visualizations were created to explore data distributions and relationships.
Correlation Analysis: Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to measure the strength and direction of linear relationships between variables.
Hypothesis Testing: T-tests and ANOVA were used to compare means between groups.
Machine Learning: Various machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest) were applied to build predictive models.
